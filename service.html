        <h4>The best grocery delivery services: our shop Fresh vs Walmart Grocery vs Instacart:</h4>
        <p>Ordering food through online grocery delivery services in the US was so easy a few weeks ago, but now that it's April 2020, that has changed. Finding a supermarket delivery time slot is a tremendous challenge, with delays among all the services.

            We're here to list the best grocery delivery options and we're scouring the time slots of each service everyday to try to point out which is not only cheapest, but offers the soonest food delivery drop-off dates. 
            
            There are new hurdles this week. In addition to the coronavirus pandemic straining food supply chains, both Amazon Fresh and Instacart have faced warehouse and delivery worker strikes. Instacart, for its part, has agreed to the offer health kit demands of its employees, so grocery delivery crisis averted there – for now.
            
            Walmart Grocery is offering pick-up and, in some locations but not all, delivery, but it's also limiting the amount of customers who can go into stores. It's unclear if this this affects grocery pick-up availability, but it may push people to opt for delivery, further reducing available time slots.
            
            Good news: there are other options, including Fresh Direct. We're also in the process of reviewing more region-specific services, like Shoprite, Publix, Giant, and Wegmans, as well as speciality apps, such as Local Harvest ShopFoodEx and GoBio.
            
            While we're normally here to help distract you with a list of fun things to do at home when bored, we're also here to inform, especially when it involves offering advice about an online service that gets you a necessity delivered like food. That way you can get everything, from heart-healthy meals, to rich comfort foods you can't live without, COVID-19 pandemic or no pandemic.
        </p> 
            


<h5>The top online grocery shopping services:</h5>
<h3>Fresh:</h3>
<p>AmazonFresh has suddenly become the best online grocery delivery service in the last six months.
     You see, it used to require a separate costly subscription (it was $119 a year), but in late 2019,
      the Seattle-based company rolled its grocery service into the normal Prime subscription that
       you probably pay for anyway. That means, you can order a bunch of perishable items and ready-made 
       meals with Prime delivery speeds at no extra cost – so long as you spend $35 on groceries.</p>
<h3>Instacart:</h3>
<p>Instacart provides AmazonFresh with real competition by sourcing foods from your local supermarket
     and delivering everything to you with same-day delivery – at least that was the case before 
     coronavirus struck. Like all services, it's a bit overloaded.But, for the most part, things are consistent
      enough when you're ordering a large shopping cart full of foods, and the small $10 delivery
       order minimum is among the best we've found. You'll have no trouble meeting it. Delivery fees
        do vary based on the size of your order, but $7.99 seems to be fairly standard from what we've experienced at checkout.
</p>
<h3> FreshDirect:</h3>
<p>FreshDirect has a nice mix of locally-grown foods and mass-market chain items from top brand you'd see in a supermarket. 
    Familiarity is its big selling point here, even if FreshDirect can't compete with AmazonFresh on price and has a delivery fee.

    Its minimum order amount of $30 is actually $5 cheaper than what Amazon requires, but you will have to pay a $5.99 
    delivery fee each time. There is a way out of that fee: its DeliveryPass offers unlimited free deliveries, better
     time slot reservations and exclusive perks. It costs $129 a year, or $79 every six months. There's also
      value-for-time weekday pass: $39 for six months with delivery slots limited from Monday to Thursday.
    
    The biggest hurdle for considering FreshDirect isn't the delivery fee, however. It's that the service is
     only available in New York and the Delaware Valley region (New Jersey, parts of eastern Pennsylvania, and Delaware).
</p>
<h3>Walmart Grocery:</h3>
<p>Walmart Grocery has its own pickup service available essentially wherever a store with Walmart Grocery 
     located, which is currently in 49 states in the US (find your closest one here). The megastore chain 
     also offers delivery, but only in select markets.
</p>
<h3> Safeway:</h3>
<p>Safeway is one of the few major grocery chains that provides delivery service, though it’s only available in locations
     surrounding stores under the Albertsons Companies umbrella – including Safeway, Albertsons, Pavilions, Vons, and more.
      Enter your zip code on the main site to see if delivery is available in your area.

    If so, you can shop either from the site or using Safeway’s mobile app and browse among whatever items your
     nearest location has in stock - but the chain is already notifying website visitors that some items might be
      limited in availability and delivery times might be impacted. Delivery orders must be a minimum of $30 and
       have a $10 fee, though that might be reduced for orders of $150 or above.
    
    
</p>
<h3> ShopRite:</h3>
<p>ShopRite is a grocery chain located in the Northeastern US (New York, Connecticut, New Jersey, Pennsylvania,
     Maryland, and Delaware), offering pickup and/or delivery near some of its locations.
